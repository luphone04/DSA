## O(n^2) (pronounced as "big O of n squared"):

This notation indicates that the running time of a program grows approximately quadratically with the input size.
For example, if we double the input size, the running time would roughly quadruple.
In the given data, m2kNaive and m2kLoop show a pattern where the running times increase significantly as the input size grows, suggesting a quadratic relationship.

O(n) (pronounced as "big O of n"):
This notation indicates that the running time of a program grows approximately linearly with the input size.
For example, if we double the input size, the running time would roughly double as well.
In the given data, m2kList shows a pattern where the running time increases at a slower rate compared to m2kNaive and m2kLoop, suggesting a linear relationship.

O(1) (pronounced as "big O of 1"):
This notation indicates that the running time of a program remains constant regardless of the input size.
It means that no matter how large the input size is, the running time will not increase significantly.
In the given data, m2kBinS shows a pattern where the running time remains relatively constant, suggesting a constant relationship.
